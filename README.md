# Vulnerability Checking
This project will demonstrate some of the many methods you can check vulnerabilities with VMs. **Kali Linux,** **Metasploitable,** **OpenVAS,** **Armitage,** **xHydra,** and **OWASPZAP** were utilized to verify and discover vulnerabilities.

**Metasploitable** - A target machine designed for testing common vulnerabilities

**OpenVAS** - A vulnerability scanner utilized in **Kali Linux.** It is capable of constructing reports of what kind of vulnerabilities are within the system and what can be done to remedy the issues.

**Armitage** - A graphical cyber attack management tool that helps test for common vulnerabilities such as backdoors

**xHydra** - A program that specializes in brute forcing password logins

**OWASPZAP** - It is a web app security scanner capable of features such as intercepting proxy servers and scanning for vulnerabilities on web sites.

## Metasploitable
Download the machine from https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

On VMWare, go to File/Open/ and then the path to the **Metasploitable** file.

Power the machine on and it should give you prompt if the virtual machine was moved or copied. You should choose that it was copied

All the assets will load and it should look like this. Keep Metasploitable running for the next steps

Power up your **Kali Linux** and find the IP address on your own machine. Use the ifconig command (for the purpose of not confusing the IP address of **Metasplotable**)

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/ifconfig.png)

To find the IP address of **Metasploitable**, you can use the NMap command to scan the whole scope of the network (ex. nmap -sn -v 192.168.x.0/24)

## OpenVAS
Go to your command prompt and use the apt-get install openvas command to iniate the installation of **OpenVAS.** If the installation does not work, you may have to update the system with the apt-get install update command

The next step to the set up is using the command gvm-setup. Be patient as it will take several minutes for it to properly install.

Once the setup is finished, there will be a user and password created for the login of the scanner. Remember to copy and paste the password on a document such as Notepad or Word. You will need this to access the features of the scanner. To start up the program, use the gvm-start command. If the browser does not pop up, then you can input the IP of  scanner onto the browser to access it (ex. https://127.0.0.1:9392)

The default username should be admin and now paste the password that was given to you by the gvm-setup command.
