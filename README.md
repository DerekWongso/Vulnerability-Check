# Vulnerability Checking
This project will demonstrate some of the many methods you can check vulnerabilities with VMs. **Kali Linux,** **Metasploitable,** **OpenVAS,** **Armitage,** **xHydra,** and **OWASPZAP** were utilized to verify and discover vulnerabilities.

**Metasploitable** - A target machine designed for testing common vulnerabilities

**OpenVAS** - A vulnerability scanner utilized in **Kali Linux.** It is capable of constructing reports of what kind of vulnerabilities are within the system and what can be done to remedy the issues.

**Armitage** - A graphical cyber attack management tool that helps test for common vulnerabilities such as backdoors

**xHydra** - A program that specializes in brute forcing password logins

**OWASPZAP** - It is a web app security scanner capable of features such as intercepting proxy servers and scanning for vulnerabilities on web sites.

## Metasploitable
Download the machine from https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/meta1.png)

On VMWare, go to File/Open/ and then the path to the **Metasploitable** file.

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/meta2.png)

Power the machine on and it should give you prompt if the virtual machine was moved or copied. You should choose that it was copied

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/meta3.png)

All the assets will load and it should look like this. Keep Metasploitable running for the next steps 

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/meta4.png)

Power up your **Kali Linux** and find the IP address on your own machine. Use the ifconig command (for the purpose of not confusing the IP address of **Metasplotable**)

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/ifconfig.png)

To find the IP address of **Metasploitable**, you can use the NMap command to scan the whole scope of the network (ex. nmap -sn -v 192.168.x.0/24)

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/nmap.png)

## OpenVAS
Go to your command prompt and use the apt-get install openvas command to iniate the installation of **OpenVAS.** If the installation does not work, you may have to update the system with the apt-get install update command

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas1.png)

The next step to the set up is using the command gvm-setup. Be patient as it will take several minutes for it to properly install.

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas2.png)

Once the setup is finished, there will be a user and password created for the login of the scanner. Remember to copy and paste the password on a document such as Notepad or Word. You will need this to access the features of the scanner. To start up the program, use the gvm-start command. If the browser does not pop up, then you can input the IP of  scanner onto the browser to access it (ex. https://127.0.0.1:9392)

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas3.png)

The default username should be admin and now paste the password that was given to you by the gvm-setup command. Once you have logged in, you should leave the browser open for 30 minutes to an hour. The assets of the scanner needs to be loaded and it takes an adequate amount of time. 

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas4.png)

Once the assets are properly loaded, go to the task tab and click on the task wizard. Input the IP address of **Metasploitable** that was found through nmap. It will then start scanning for vulnerabilities on that IP. This process will also take several minutes

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas6.png)

Once the scan is complete, go to the report tab and click on the task of the scan on the bottom. You can now choose to generate a report in several formats. For the purpose of the demonstration, I chose to to generate the report in PDF.

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/openvas7.png)

You can open the report to see what kind of vulnerabilities the system has. From here, you can see what holes you can fix within the security of your system. Here are some samples of vulnerabilities.

## Armitage
To install **Armitage,** use the command apt-get install armitage. To start it, you use the armitage command and click connect

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/arm1.png)

Use the service postgresql start command. If it does not find a database, it will give you some options to create one. I am using Kali Linux 2.x, so I would have to use the msfdb init command

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/arm2.png)

Once it it loaded up, click on the host tab, nmap scan, intense scan, and then input the IP address of **Metasploitable.** 

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/arm3.png)

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/arm4.png)

You can right-click on the graphic of the **Metasploitable** IP and check the services tab. This will list which ports are. 

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/arm5.png)

With the information used from the services we know that the **Metasploitable** shell port is 1524 and open. You can use this information to set up a backdoor attack. You can use the telnet command to create a backdoor straight to the root of **Metasploitable.**

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/backdoor.png)

## xHydra
xHydra is an application that can be opened through the start menu of Kali. Once the app is started, you can input the address of **Metasploitable,** the port number, nad the protocol it uses. 

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/hydra1.png)

If you have a list of numerous passwords, you can set a path for the text file and it will utilize it in the brute force process. You can find one and create one yourself. Change the username to msfadmin.

![github-small](https://github.com/DerekWongso/Vulnerability-Check/blob/main/images/hydra2.png)

Once everything is properly set up, you can start the brute force process. It will use every password on the list until it finds the correct one.
