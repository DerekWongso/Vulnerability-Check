# Vulnerability Checking
This project will demonstrate some of the many methods you can check vulnerabilities with VMs. **Kali Linux,** **Metasploitable,** **OpenVAS,** **Armitage,** **xHydra,** and **OWASPZAP** were utilized to verify and discover vulnerabilities.

**Metasploitable** - A target machine designed for testing common vulnerabilities

**OpenVAS** - A vulnerability scanner utilized in **Kali Linux.** It is capable of constructing reports of what kind of vulnerabilities are within the system and what can be done to remedy the issues.

**Armitage** - A graphical cyber attack management tool that helps test for common vulnerabilities such as backdoors

**xHydra** - A program that specializes in brute forcing password logins

**OWASPZAP** - It is a web app security scanner capable of features such as intercepting proxy servers and scanning for vulnerabilities on web sites.

## Metasploitable
Download the machine from https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

On VMWare, go to File/Open/ and then the path to the **Metasploitable** file.

Power the machine on and it should give you prompt if the virtual machine was moved or copied. You should choose that it was copied

All the assets will load and it should look like this. Keep Metasploitable running for the next steps

Power up your **Kali Linux** and find the IP address on your own machine. Use the ifconig command (for the purpose of not confusing the IP address of **Metasplotable**)

To find the IP address of **Metasploitable**, you can use the NMap command to scan the whole scope of the network (ex. nmap -sn -v 192.168.x.0/24)
